	<span><b>Python - Mail Finder</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		This tiny script is capable of<br>
		finding E-Mail adresses inside a string.<br>
		The script uses the <i>input()</i> function to interact with <br>
		the user.<br><br><br>

		- Building it was quite funny ;) -<br><br>

		<span><b>Python - Password Checker</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		There are many Passwords out there - many weak ones.<br>
		The goal with this script was to enter some potential passwords.<br>
		Then the script should check wheter its secure or not.<br><br>
		It follows several guidelines:<br>
			- has the password more than 8 characters ? <br>
			- has the password more than 2 numbers ? <br>
			- has the password more than 1 special character ? <br>
		Only if this tests were sucessful - the passwors is rated as secure.<br><br>
